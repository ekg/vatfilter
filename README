This filter relies upon annotations in a VCF file generated by VAT (the variant
annotation tool), http://info.gersteinlab.org/VAT.

Provided a VCF file with VAT annotations under the VA= INFO tag, this tool will
add up the number of transcripts affected by the variant.  A synonymous change
overlapping any number of transcripts in the same frame will produce
VAchange=0, whereas a nonsynonymous change will produce VAchange=N for the
number of affected transcripts.

To use, feed a VCF file into the script on stdin.
